## 📝 Slash Commands (Claude Code)

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `/worktree-start <type> "description"` | Create worktree (smart) | `/worktree-start rails "Add JWT auth"` |
| `/worktree-start <type> name` | Create worktree (manual) | `/worktree-start rails user-auth` |
| `/worktree-compare [branch]` | Compare changes | `/worktree-compare main` |
| `/worktree-merge [branch]` | Merge and cleanup | `/worktree-merge main` |
| `/worktree-list` | List worktrees | `/worktree-list` |

## 🔄 Basic Workflow

```bash
# 1️⃣ CREATE - Smart mode with detailed description
/worktree-start rails "Add two-factor authentication with SMS and email support"

# 2️⃣ WORK - Navigate and code
cd ../feat/two-factor-auth-sms-email
# ... code, commits ...

# 3️⃣ COMPARE - Review before merge
/worktree-compare main

# 4️⃣ TEST - Validate it works
bin/rails test              # Rails
vendor/bin/phpunit          # WordPress

# 5️⃣ MERGE - Integrate and clean
/worktree-merge main
```

## 🎯 Essential Git Commands

### Within Worktree

```bash
# View status
git status

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "[feat] Description"

# Push to remote
git push origin branch-name

# View diff of current changes
git diff

# View commit log
git log --oneline

# Temporary stash (if needed)
git stash
git stash pop
```

### From Main Repository

```bash
# View all worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove specific worktree
git worktree remove /path/to/worktree

# Clean stale references
git worktree prune

# View merged branches
git branch --merged main
```

## 📊 Comparison: Smart vs Manual Mode

| Aspect | Smart Mode | Manual Mode |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Command** | `/worktree-start rails "Add JWT auth"` | `/worktree-start rails jwt-auth` |
| **Branch name** | Auto-generated by Claude | Use what you specify |
| **FEATURE.md** | ✅ Created with context | ❌ Not created |
| **Suggestions** | ✅ Files to review | ❌ No suggestions |
| **Checklist** | ✅ TODO generated | ❌ No checklist |
| **Speed** | Slower (~5s) | Faster (~1s) |
| **Recommended use** | Complex features | Quick fixes |

**💡 Rule:** If the project takes >1 hour, use smart mode.

## ⚡ Shortcuts and Tips

### Quick Navigation

```bash
# Useful aliases (add to .bashrc/.zshrc)
alias wl='/worktree-list'
alias ws='/worktree-start'
alias wc='/worktree-compare'
alias wm='/worktree-merge'

# Quick navigation
cd ..     # Go up to parent directory
cd -      # Return to previous directory
```

### Multiple Terminals/IDEs

```bash
# Terminal 1: Main work
cd /path/to/project

# Terminal 2: Feature A
cd /path/to/project
/worktree-start rails "Feature A"
cd ../feat/feature-a

# Terminal 3: Feature B
cd /path/to/project
/worktree-start rails "Feature B"
cd ../feat/feature-b

# Each terminal works independently
```

### Quick Weekly Cleanup

```bash
# Every Friday
/worktree-list cleanup && /worktree-list prune
```

## 🔍 Quick Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Quick Solution |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| "Branch already exists" | Worktree already exists | `/worktree-list` → verify |
| "Uncommitted changes" | Changes without commit | `git add . && git commit -m "msg"` |
| "Not in a worktree" | Command in main repo | `cd ../feature-branch` |
| "Merge conflict" | Files in conflict | Resolve manually |
| Worktree won't delete | Directory in use | Close IDE/terminal |

---

## 🎓 Common Workflows

### Workflow 1: Normal Feature

```bash
/worktree-start rails "Add feature X"
cd ../feat/feature-x
# ... work ...
git add . && git commit -m "[feat] Add X"
/worktree-compare main
/worktree-merge main
```

### Workflow 2: Urgent Hotfix

```bash
# While working on feature
/worktree-start rails "Hotfix: Critical bug"
cd ../hotfix/critical-bug
# ... fix ...
git add . && git commit -m "[fix] Critical bug"
/worktree-merge main
# Return to feature without interruptions
```

### Workflow 3: Experimentation

```bash
/worktree-start rails "Experiment with X"
cd ../feat/experiment-x
# ... try things ...
# Doesn't work? No problem
cd ..
rm -rf feat/experiment-x
/worktree-list prune
```

### Workflow 4: Code Review

```bash
/worktree-start rails colleague-branch
cd ../colleague-branch
# ... review code, run tests ...
# No merge, just review
cd ..
rm -rf colleague-branch
/worktree-list prune
```

## 💾 Useful Git Commands

### View Changes

```bash
# Diff of working directory
git diff

# Diff staged
git diff --staged

# Diff with another branch
git diff main..HEAD

# View specific file
git diff main -- path/to/file

# Change stats
git diff --stat main..HEAD
```

### Logs and History

```bash
# Compact log
git log --oneline -10

# Log with graph
git log --oneline --graph --all

# Commits not in main
git log main..HEAD --oneline

# View specific commit
git show <commit-hash>
```

### Branches

```bash
# List branches
git branch

# View merged
git branch --merged main

# View unmerged
git branch --no-merged main

# Delete local branch
git branch -d branch-name
git branch -D branch-name  # force

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

---

## 🔧 Recommended Configuration

### Global Git Config

```bash
# Better log alias
git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --graph --all --decorate"

# Better status alias
git config --global alias.st "status -sb"

# Better diff alias
git config --global alias.df "diff --color --stat"

# Auto-prune on fetch
git config --global fetch.prune true

# Default push behavior
git config --global push.default current
```

### Install Delta (Better Diffs)

```bash
# macOS
brew install git-delta

# Linux
cargo install git-delta

# Auto-used by /worktree-compare
```

---

## 📚 Commands by Frequency of Use

### Daily (80%)

```bash
/worktree-start rails "Feature description"
cd ../feature-branch
git add . && git commit -m "msg"
/worktree-compare main
/worktree-merge main
```

### Weekly (15%)

```bash
/worktree-list cleanup
/worktree-list prune
/worktree-list  # View state
```

### Occasional (5%)

```bash
git worktree remove /path/to/worktree
git branch -D branch-name
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns (Avoid These)

### ❌ DON'T do

```bash
# Create worktree without meaningful description
/worktree-start rails "test"
/worktree-start rails "changes"
/worktree-start rails "wip"

# Merge without comparing first
/worktree-merge main  # Without /worktree-compare before

# Have 10+ worktrees open
# CONFUSING!

# Navigate between worktrees in same terminal
cd ../worktree1
cd ../worktree2  # Confusion guaranteed

# Do rm -rf without git worktree remove
rm -rf ../feature-branch
# Leaves orphaned references
```

### ✅ DO

```bash
# Specific description in smart mode
/worktree-start rails "Add OAuth2 with Google and GitHub providers"

# Always compare before merge
/worktree-compare main
/worktree-merge main

# Maximum 2-3 active worktrees
# Manageable

# Use separate terminal/IDE per worktree
# Each in its space

# Use proper commands for cleanup
/worktree-merge main  # Auto-cleanup
```

## 🎯 KPIs of Good Usage

**Indicators you're using it well:**

- ✅ Features merged in <3 days
- ✅ `/worktree-list` shows <4 worktrees
- ✅ Always use `/worktree-compare` before merge
- ✅ Tests pass before each merge
- ✅ Weekly cleanup keeps workspace clean

**Warning signs:**

- ⚠️ 10+ worktrees open
- ⚠️ Branches with 2+ weeks without merge
- ⚠️ Many "WIP" commits
- ⚠️ Never use `/worktree-compare`
- ⚠️ Always have merge conflicts
