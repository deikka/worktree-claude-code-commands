## What is This?

A set of **slash commands for Claude Code** that make working with git worktrees incredibly easy and intuitive.

**Worktrees** allow you to have multiple checkouts of the same git repository simultaneously. Instead of constantly doing stash/switch/pop, you can work on multiple features at the same time, each in its own directory.

**This system** eliminates all the complexity of manually managing worktrees, providing:

✅ Smart worktree creation with AI assistance
✅ Visual comparison of changes before merge
✅ Safe merge with automatic cleanup
✅ Frictionless management and maintenance
✅ Specific support for Rails and WordPress

---

## Why Use Worktrees?

### Traditional Problem

```bash
# You're working on feature A
git checkout -b feature-a
# ... making changes ...

# OH NO! Urgent bug
git stash                # Save changes
git checkout main        # Switch branch
git checkout -b hotfix   # New branch
# ... fix bug ...
git checkout feature-a   # Go back
git stash pop            # Recover changes
# Conflicts with stash! 😱
```

### Solution with Worktrees

```bash
# Terminal 1: Working on feature A
/worktree-start rails "Feature A"
cd ../feat/feature-a
# ... making changes peacefully ...

# Terminal 2: Urgent bug
/worktree-start rails "Hotfix"
cd ../hotfix/urgent-bug
# ... fix the bug ...
/worktree-merge main

# Terminal 1: Continue working without interruptions
# No stash, no conflicts, no stress ✨
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Real parallel development** - Multiple features at the same time
2. **Zero context switching** - Each feature in its own space
3. **Independent tests** - Test one feature without affecting others
4. **Uninterrupted hotfixes** - Fix bugs without touching your current work
5. **Easy code review** - Checkout colleagues' branches without stash
6. **Safe experimentation** - Try ideas without risk

---

```

---

## Quick Start

### 5 Minutes to Your First Worktree

```bash
# 1. Create worktree (smart mode)
/worktree-start rails "Add JWT authentication with refresh tokens"

# 2. Navigate and work
cd ../feat/jwt-auth-refresh-tokens
cat FEATURE.md  # Read guide generated by Claude
# ... code, commits ...

# 3. Compare before merge
/worktree-compare main

# 4. Test
bin/rails test  # Or your test command

# 5. Merge and cleanup
/worktree-merge main

# Feature complete! 🎉
```

### Most Common Command (80% usage)

```bash
/worktree-start [rails|wp] "Your feature description"
```

**Smart Mode Features:**
- Claude analyzes your description
- Generates branch name automatically
- Creates `FEATURE.md` with checklist and context
- Suggests relevant files to start with

---

## Available Commands

### `/worktree-start` - Create worktree

**Syntax:**
```bash
/worktree-start [rails|wp] "feature description"  # Smart mode (recommended)
/worktree-start [rails|wp] branch-name           # Manual mode
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Rails smart mode
/worktree-start rails "Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub"
# → Creates: feat/oauth2-auth-google-github + FEATURE.md

# WordPress manual mode
/worktree-start wp custom-widget
# → Creates: custom-widget (no FEATURE.md)
```

**What it does:**
1. Validates project type and state
2. (Smart) Claude generates appropriate branch name
3. Creates new worktree in sibling directory
4. (Smart) Generates `FEATURE.md` with complete guide
5. Setup tracking branch on remote

**[Complete documentation →](./worktree-start.md)**

---

### `/worktree-compare` - Compare before merge

**Syntax:**
```bash
/worktree-compare [target-branch]  # Default: main/master auto-detect
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Compare with main
/worktree-compare

# Compare with develop
/worktree-compare develop
```

**What it shows:**
- 📊 Change summary (files, +lines, -lines)
- 📝 Commit list
- ⚠️ Detection of potential conflicts
- 📋 Full diff for review

**[Complete documentation →](./worktree-compare.md)**

---

### `/worktree-merge` - Merge and cleanup

**Syntax:**
```bash
/worktree-merge [target-branch]  # Default: main/master auto-detect
```

**Example:**
```bash
/worktree-merge main
```

**What it does (all automatic):**
1. ✅ Validates state (uncommitted changes check)
2. 🔀 Merge to target branch
3. ⬆️ Push to remote
4. 🗑️ Remove worktree directory
5. 🌿 Delete local/remote branch
6. 📍 Leaves you in main branch

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Always use `/worktree-compare` before merge.

**[Complete documentation →](./worktree-merge.md)**

---

### `/worktree-list` - List and manage

**Syntax:**
```bash
/worktree-list              # List active worktrees
/worktree-list cleanup      # Remove merged worktrees
/worktree-list prune        # Clean stale references
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# View current state
/worktree-list

# Cleanup after merges
/worktree-list cleanup

# Clean orphaned references
/worktree-list prune
```

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Normal Feature

```bash
# 1. Create worktree
/worktree-start rails "Add two-factor authentication"
cd ../feat/two-factor-auth

# 2. Work
# ... code, commits ...

# 3. Review
/worktree-compare main
bin/rails test

# 4. Merge
/worktree-merge main
```

**Typical time:** 1-3 days
**Complexity:** Normal

---

### Workflow 2: Urgent Hotfix

```bash
# While working on feature (Terminal 1)
cd ../feat/big-feature

# Hotfix (Terminal 2 - new)
cd /path/to/project
/worktree-start rails "Hotfix: Critical login bug"
cd ../hotfix/critical-login-bug
# ... quick fix ...
/worktree-merge main

# Terminal 1: Continue working without interruptions
```

**Typical time:** 30 min - 2 hours
**Complexity:** High urgency, low complexity

---

### Workflow 3: Parallel Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Feature A (large, takes days)
/worktree-start rails "Complete dashboard redesign"
cd ../feat/dashboard-redesign

# Terminal 2: Feature B (small, takes hours)
/worktree-start rails "Add PDF export button"
cd ../feat/pdf-export-button

# Terminal 2: Finish B first
/worktree-merge main

# Terminal 1: Continue with A
# When done:
/worktree-merge main
```

**Typical time:** Variable
**Complexity:** High (multiple management)

---

### Workflow 4: Experimentation

```bash
# Test new idea without commitment
/worktree-start rails "Experiment: React components instead of Hotwire"
cd ../feat/experiment-react-components

# Experiment...
# ... doesn't work well ...

# Abandon without consequences
cd /path/to/project
rm -rf ../feat/experiment-react-components
/worktree-list prune

# Main project unaffected
```

**Typical time:** Variable (abandon OK)
**Complexity:** Low (safe to fail)

---

### Workflow 5: Code Review

```bash
# Colleague requests review of their branch
/worktree-start rails colleague-feature-branch
cd ../colleague-feature-branch

# Local review
# ... read code, run tests ...

# No merge, just review
cd /path/to/project
rm -rf ../colleague-feature-branch
/worktree-list prune
```

**Typical time:** 30 min - 1 hour
**Complexity:** Low

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Smart Mode

**❌ Avoid:**
```bash
/worktree-start rails user-auth
```

**✅ Prefer:**
```bash
/worktree-start rails "Add JWT authentication with refresh token support"
```

**Why:** Claude generates better branch name, creates useful guide, suggests files.

---

### 2. ALWAYS Compare Before Merge

**❌ Dangerous:**
```bash
/worktree-merge main  # Without reviewing
```

**✅ Safe:**
```bash
/worktree-compare main  # Careful review
bin/rails test          # Tests pass
/worktree-merge main    # Then merge
```

---

### 3. Short Features (<3 days)

**❌ Long branch:**
- 2 weeks of development
- Many potential conflicts
- Difficult review

**✅ Short branch:**
- 1-3 days of development
- Frequent merge
- Minimal conflicts
- Easy review

---

### 4. Separate Terminal/IDE per Worktree

**❌ Confusing:**
```bash
cd ../worktree-a
# work...
cd ../worktree-b
# where am I?
```

**✅ Clear:**
- Terminal 1: worktree-a
- Terminal 2: worktree-b
- Each in its own space

---

### 5. Regular Cleanup

```bash
# Every Friday
/worktree-list cleanup
/worktree-list prune
```

**Keeps workspace clean and organized.**

---

### 6. Tests Before Merge

```bash
# Rails
bin/rails test
bundle exec rubocop

# WordPress
npm run build
vendor/bin/phpunit  # if configured
```

**Don't merge if tests fail.**

---

### 7. Clear Commit Messages

**❌ Bad:**
```
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "fix"
git commit -m "WIP"
```

**✅ Good:**
```
git commit -m "[feat] Add JWT token generation"
git commit -m "[fix] Correct token expiration logic"
git commit -m "[test] Add integration tests for auth flow"
```

---

## FAQ

### General

**Q: How many worktrees can I have?**
A: Technically unlimited, but recommended 2-3 maximum to avoid confusion.

**Q: Do worktrees share the same .git?**
A: Yes, all point to the same repository with different checkouts.

**Q: Does it affect my main project?**
A: No, each worktree is completely independent.

**Q: Can I push from a worktree?**
A: Yes, it works exactly like a normal branch.

**Q: What happens if I manually delete a worktree?**
A: Git keeps references. Use `/worktree-list prune` to clean up.

---

### Smart Mode vs Manual

**Q: When to use smart mode?**
A: Whenever the feature takes >1 hour. Claude generates useful context.

**Q: When to use manual mode?**
A: Quick fixes (<30 min) where you don't need AI assistance.

**Q: Does Claude always generate good names?**
A: 90% of the time yes. If you don't like it, you can edit the branch name later.

---

### Common Problems

**Q: "Branch already exists" error?**
A: You already have a worktree with that name. Use `/worktree-list` to verify.

**Q: "Uncommitted changes" when merging?**
A: Commit your changes first: `git add . && git commit -m "msg"`

**Q: How to resolve merge conflicts?**
A: Manually: open files, resolve <<<<<<, git add, git commit.

**Q: Worktree won't delete?**
A: Close all terminals/IDEs using that directory first.

---

### Performance

**Q: Do worktrees consume a lot of space?**
A: No, they share the .git directory. Only working tree files are duplicated.

**Q: Is it slower than normal branches?**
A: No, performance is identical.

---

### Teams

**Q: Does it work with teams?**
A: Yes, each developer manages their own worktrees locally.

**Q: Should I commit .claude/?**
A: No, install.sh automatically adds it to .gitignore.

**Q: Can I use it with Pull Requests?**
A: Yes, push your branch normally and create PR. Then `/worktree-list cleanup`.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Commands don't appear in Claude Code

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify installation
ls .claude/commands/

# Reinstall
./install.sh
```

---

### Problem: "Not in a worktree" error

**Cause:** Running command from main repo

**Solution:**
```bash
cd ../your-feature-branch
/worktree-compare main
```

---

### Problem: Merge conflicts

**Cause:** Files modified in both branches

**Solution:**
```bash
# Git pauses the merge
# 1. Open files with <<<<<<<
# 2. Resolve manually
# 3. git add <resolved-files>
# 4. git commit
# 5. git push origin main
# 6. Manual cleanup of worktree
```

---

### Problem: Worktree directory won't delete

**Cause:** IDE/terminal using the directory

**Solution:**
```bash
# Close all windows/terminals
# Then:
git worktree remove /path/to/worktree --force

# Or manually:
rm -rf /path/to/worktree
/worktree-list prune
```

---

### Problem: Branch won't delete

**Cause:** Branch has unmerged commits

**Solution:**
```bash
# See which commits aren't merged
git log main..your-branch

# Force delete if you're sure
git branch -D your-branch
```

---

### Problem: "Permission denied" in install.sh

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Final Notes

**This system is designed to make your life easier, not more complicated.**

If you find the commands confusing or they don't work as expected, it's a bug - please report.

The goal is for you to use worktrees without thinking about the underlying complexity. If you have to read git documentation to understand what a command does, we've failed.

**Happy parallel development! 🚀**
